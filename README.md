# Portshift Jenkins CI Plugin #

This plugin for Jenkins enables you to scan docker images for vulnerabilities in Jenkins, and report results to the Portshift server.

## Operational prerequisites for the plugin  ##

1. Docker must be installed on the same machine as Jenkins. If your job is configured to use a node other than the Master node, then Docker is required only on the build Jenkins node (slave). 
2. A *jenkins* user must be added to the *docker* group, with permission to run Docker:

     ```
     sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
     ```
## Install and configure the plugin
1. In Jenkins, select **Manage Jenkins** and then select **Manage Plugins** from the list. Ensure that the list of available plugins is up to date. 
2. Select the **Available** tab, search for Portshift Vulnerability Scanner, and select it.  Click on **Download the Plugin**. This will install the plugin.

## Use the plugin
You can use the plugin in the build process in Freestyle and Pipelines jobs. You can configure the job to scan the image during the build process.

### Freestyle jobs

For Freestyle jobs, add a build step to scan the image with Portshift, as part of the job configuration. 
1. In Jenkins, in the **Configure** page for a job, click **Add Build Step**.
2. Select **Portshift Vulnerability Scanner**.

3. Enter the image name.
4. Enter the access key and secret key for the Portshift *Service* user.
5. Enter the external IP of your Jenkins runner as *scanner-ip*.
6. Enter the URL of the Portshift server (*console.portshift.io* in most cases)

### Pipeline jobs
For Pipeline jobs, the build step to scan the image with Portshift is included in a pipeline script, as part of the job configuration.

1. In Jenkins, in the **Configure** page for a job, scroll to the **Pipeline** section.
1. Add a snippet, such as the following, to the pipeline script, to include a step to scan the image.

## Plugin output

You can see the results of the scan in the Console Output.

You can also see results of the scan as an HTML page. An artifact named *scanResults.html* is created in the project workspace. In the Jenkins build menu, select Portshift Vulnerability Scanner, and then select the job whose results you wish to see.



## Build the plugin (instructions for Ubuntu)

* If JDK is not installed, install it
```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

* Install Maven3 (must be 3)

*  Build

   When in the root directory, where *pom.xml* resides:
```
     mvn package
```
   **Note**: the first time this command is invoked, many downloads will occur and it will take  some time.


## Publicly release a new version to jenkins-ci.org ##
See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins#HostingPlugins-Releasingtojenkinsci.org. It describes several alternatives; use the following:

1. If not already done, create a *settings.xml* file with your credentials, as described.
2. Run the following, and accept defaults for all prompts:
```
